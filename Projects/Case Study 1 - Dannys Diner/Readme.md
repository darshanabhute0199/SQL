# Case Study Name : Danny's Diner


## Introduction
Danny's Diner, a nice local restaurant, faces the problem of attracting and retaining customers in a competitive market. To succeed in this competitive environment, owner Danny aims to establish a stronger bond with his customers. Danny's Diner provided a sample dataset for this case study, which was used to find significant customer insights.

Our investigation will concentrate on three major areas:

* `Customer Visiting Patterns` : We'll look at how frequently customers visit, how to identify loyal customers, and potential trends in visit timing.
* `Spending Habits` : By analysing client spending data, we can determine average order value, identify high-spending individuals, and obtain insight into overall revenue generating.
* `Menu Preferences` : We'll look into which menu items are the most popular with consumers, so Danny may customise his offerings to their preferences.

By unlocking these insights, Danny can personalize the dining experience for his customers. This could involve tailored recommendations, targeted promotions, or a revamped loyalty program. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance customer satisfaction and encourage repeat business, propelling Danny's Diner towards sustained success. This case study aims to provide Danny with the data-driven knowledge he needs to make informed decisions about his customer loyalty program and secure a thriving future for his beloved diner.
